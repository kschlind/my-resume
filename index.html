		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>Hello. I'm an art director, designer, and illustrator based in Brooklyn. I've spent the last ten years managing in-house design teams at nonprofit, arts &amp; cultural, and educational institutions and enjoy working freelance and pro bono for similar clients. Right now I am the associate creative director at Pratt Institute.</p>

		<p>I also recently earned a Master's degree in Design Management at Pratt, where we focused on the value of design and its potential impact on social and environmental problems. My projects in the program have included brand strategy, marketing, operations management, and communications strategy with clients including Colgate, the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, and the Taproot Foundation.</p>

		<p>I'm excited about typography, printmaking and illustration. I sew, draw, enjoy long bike trips and will probably bake you some vegan cookies if you ask. When I'm at my most productive I organize art projects and shows as part of the Philadelphia-based Artclash Collective.</p>
